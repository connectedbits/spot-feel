# Spot Feel

A DMN FEEL implementation in Ruby

This gem implements a subset of FEEL (Friendly Enough Expression Language) as defined in the [DMN 1.3 specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/PDF) with some additional extensions.

FEEL expressions are parsed into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and then evaluated in a context. The context is a hash of variables that are available to the expression. Expressions can also invoke built-in and user-defined functions.

Expressions are safe, side-effect free, and deterministic. They are ideal for capturing business logic for storage in a database or embedded in DMN or BPMN documents for execution in a workflow engine like [spot-flow](https://github.com/connectedbits/spot_flow).

This project was inspired by these excellent libraries:

- [feelin](https://github.com/nikku/feelin)
- [dmn-eval-js](https://github.com/mineko-io/dmn-eval-js)

## Usage

To evaluate an expression:

```ruby
SpotFeel.eval('"ðŸ‘‹ Hello " + name', context: { name: 'World' })
# => "ðŸ‘‹ Hello World"
```

A slightly more complex example:

```ruby
SpotFeel.eval('if person.age >= 18 then "adult" else "minor"', context: { person: { name: "Eric", age: 59 } })
# => "adult"
```

Calling a built-in function:

```ruby
SpotFeel.eval('sum([1, 2, 3])')
# => 6
```

Calling a user-defined function:

```ruby
SpotFeel.eval('reverse("Hello World!")', context: { "reverse": ->(s) { s.reverse } })
# => "!dlroW olleH"
```

To evaluate a unary tests:

```ruby
SpotFeel.test(3, '<= 10, > 50'))
# => true
```

```ruby
SpotFeel.test("Eric", '"Bob", "Holly", "Eric"')
# => true
```

To evaluate a DMN decision table:

```ruby
decisions = SpotFeel.decisions_from_xml(fixture_source("fine.dmn"))
context = {
  violation: {
    type: "speed",
    actual_speed: 100,
    speed_limit: 65,
  }
}
result = SpotFeel::Dmn::Decision.decide('fine_decision', decisions:, context:)
# => { "amount" => 1000, "points" => 7 })
```
